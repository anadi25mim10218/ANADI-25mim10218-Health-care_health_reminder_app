PROJECT REPORT
Project Title:
Healthcare Treatment Management – Backend API (Django)
1. Introduction
My name is Anadi khare (25mim10218) i have made this project is the backend system for a small healthcare management application under vityarthi flipped course project.
The idea is to keep records of doctors, patients, staff members, exercises and treatments.
The backend is made in Django and Django REST Framework, and the data is shared in JSON format so that it can be connected with any frontend or mobile app.
The system also uses token authentication, so only logged-in users can access their features.
2. Aim of the Project
To build a working backend for a healthcare system.
To allow different types of users (doctor, patient, staff) to use different features.
To store treatment details properly.
To make an API that is simple to extend later.
3. Technologies Used
Python
Django
Django REST Framework
SQLite (or any database supported by Django)
4. Brief Description
When a new user registers, a profile for that user is automatically created.
The user can be a doctor, patient, or staff member depending on the data given.
Doctors can add exercises and create treatments for patients.
Patients can see their treatments.
Staff members can be assigned to a treatment.
Records can be created daily for tracking progress.
Notifications can also be sent to patients.
Different permission classes are made so that only authorized users can access certain features.
5. Main Modules
User
Handles registration, login, and token creation.
Each user gets a profile automatically through Django signals.
Doctor
Doctors have their own profile and can create exercises.
Doctors can also create treatments for patients.
Patient
Patients have relatives linked and can check their own treatments and notifications.
Staff
Staff members can be assigned to treatments.
Exercise
Contains exercise name, code, instructions and level.
Treatment
Connects doctor, patient, staff, and exercises.
Also stores medicine name, start date and end date.
Record
Stores daily progress on a particular treatment.
Notification
Simple notification table linked with user, treatment and patient.
6. Database Overview (Simple Explanation)
User → Default Django user table
Profile → More details about user
Doctor, Patient, Staff → Separate tables linked to user
Exercise → List of exercises
Treatment → Doctor + Patient + Staff + Exercises
Record → Daily progress of treatment
Notification → Messages for patients
Relations used:
One-to-One
Foreign Keys
Many-to-Many
7. Important API Endpoints (Summary)
User
/register/ – Create new user
/login/ – Login and get token
Exercise
/exercise/ – List or create exercise
/exercise/<id>/ – Edit or delete exercise
Treatment
/treatment/ – Create or list treatments
/treatment/list/ – List with more detail
Patient
/login/patient/treatments/ – Treatments of current patient
/login/patient/<id>/ – Specific treatment
/login/patient/relatives/ – Patient relatives
Record
/create/record/ – Mark progress
Notification
/create/notification/ – Create
/login/patient/notifications/ – List
8. Permissions
Custom permissions:
IsDoctor – Only doctor can access
IsStaffMember – Only staff member
IsOwnerOrReadOnly – Used for exercises so only the owner can edit
9. How the System Works (Short Notes)
User registers → profile is created → token generated
Doctor logs in → adds exercises → creates treatments
Patient logs in → sees treatment details
Staff member → assigned to treatment
Records are created regularly for progress
Notifications are sent if needed
10. Testing
The API was tested using Postman.
Different roles were tested with their permissions.
Tested invalid fields, wrong login, missing data etc.
11. Conclusion
The system provides a basic working backend for a healthcare platform.
It supports different user roles and stores treatment data in an organized way.
The API can be connected easily to an app or web interface.
The project can be expanded further by adding appointment system, messaging, or reports.
